This project, conveniently called **organ**, is a project made for a school course that required students
to design and develop an application in any technology. As a person interested in church music, I chose
a database of pipe organ as my project topic and decided to learn Django by implementing it. The application
features information about:

* pipe organ instruments
* pipe organ builders
* organ stop types
* church music performers
* church music concerts

### Dependencies

* **Python 3** â€“ the project is not and will never be compatible with Python 2
* `Django`, obviously
* `django-htmlmin` for minifying HTML output
* `django-markdown-app` for a Markdown editor in management panel
* `django-nested-admin` for nested inlines in management panel (for easier instrument edition)
* `django-debug-toolbar` for (unsurprisingly) a debug toolbar
* `django-url-tools-py3` for URL manipulation
* `Markdown` for instrument description formatting
* `Pillow` for processing images
