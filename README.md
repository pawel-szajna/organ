This project, conveniently called **organ**, is a project made for a school course that required students
to design and develop an application in any technology. As a person interested in church music, I chose
a database of pipe organ as my project topic and decided to learn Django by implementing it. The completed
application will feature information about:

* pipe organ instruments
* organ stop types
* church music performers
* church music concerts
